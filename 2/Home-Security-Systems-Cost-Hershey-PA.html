Wyze's recently launched Total Motion Capture solves this issue for $1.50 each month per camera. It enables recording of all motion the camera senses, for approximately 5 minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and instantly starts another, without any spaces in between.
