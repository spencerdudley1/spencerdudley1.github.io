<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Likewise nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
