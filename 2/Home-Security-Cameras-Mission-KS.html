Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and transmit pictures of a specific location of interest and are either monitored from another location by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the specified area (La Vigne et al. 2011).

<p>This cool wise alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device. During screening, we found it was simple to arm and disarm and the motion detection was precise, with the siren rapidly triggering when movement was identified. We enjoy that it also lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For most homes, you'll require several Minuts throughout your home, which can get pricey. It's also worth noting that it needs to be set up on the ceiling (it only monitors for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly.
