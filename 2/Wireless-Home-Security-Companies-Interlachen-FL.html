<p>Three huge benefits of wireless security systems for renters are their expandability, mobility and impermanence. Renters, unlike property owners, typically prevent making permanent modifications to their homes. Hardwired security systems for that reason aren't useful; they include drilling into walls and installing irreversible electrical circuits. On the other hand, wireless security utilizes equipment that's either freestanding or affixed to walls and entranceways with removable adhesive.
