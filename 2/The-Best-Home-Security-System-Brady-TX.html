A lot of smart cameras can be set to do things like this, however few make things as basic as Hive have done within their app, and I salute them for that.

Rather, you can filter occasion notifications just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When utilized in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent notifies every time you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
