"As soon as the criminal activity and offense figures were adapted to appraise the general down pattern in offenses and criminal activities," criminologists discovered in one study, "decreases were kept in mind in certain categories but there was no proof to suggest that the cameras had lowered criminal activity overall in the city centre."
