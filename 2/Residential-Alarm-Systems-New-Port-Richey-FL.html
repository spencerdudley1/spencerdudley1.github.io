<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>

You can get a photovoltaic panel device so you do not need to eliminate the battery as often, however it'll cost you extra.
