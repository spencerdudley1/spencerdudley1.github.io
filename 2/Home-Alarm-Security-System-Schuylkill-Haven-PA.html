You might even offer instructions on how to get into your structure. As just recently as 10 years back, customers did not have access to technology that let them manage their own home security systems. Smart alarm changed that. Originally, traditional security systems were hardwired into the home and monitored by a central station, usually a home alarm company. The customer paid month-to-month fees.</p>
