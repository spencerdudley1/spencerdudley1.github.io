Part of that is because ADT has more customers than most brands-- which suggests it has more opportunities to face problems. However part of it is the method ADT offers its equipment. When a company works with multiple dealers and suppliers, its customers are going to get a broad range of experiences. Some will be good, and some will be bad.</p>
<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter occasion alerts only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is readily available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is more useful when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs whenever you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
