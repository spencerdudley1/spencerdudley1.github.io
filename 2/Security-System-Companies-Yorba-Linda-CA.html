Battery-powered Wi-Fi cameras are the simplest to install since you can put them just about anywhere (as long as they can connect to your router) without needing to snake a power cable television into your home to plug into an outlet. These kinds of cameras usually utilize rechargeable batteries that can be easily popped out and taken inside for charging with a USB cable television, but they tend to drain pipes quickly in cooler weather.
