Then the phone plays a screeching, electronic sound wave to the camera to send the WiFi information. (You need to play this at full volume or it won't work). Windows smash, pets groan, cats squeal, infants weep. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the very first ten seconds. It does not work. And it never works.</p>

<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment.

Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.
