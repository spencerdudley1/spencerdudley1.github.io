IP cameras that are linked to the very same network, typically by method of a PoE switch, are then able to send video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, just because they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transfer video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is connected to the exact same network as the NVR.
