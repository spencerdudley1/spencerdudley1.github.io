<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft.

However, you do require to subscribe to the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 per month) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get signals on your phone if the sensing units have been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are readily available that have key fobs and extra sensing units, too.</p>
