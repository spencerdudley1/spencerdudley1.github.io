<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>

The designs we have actually reviewed so far either record very short clips, leave giant gaps in between those brief clips, or need charging on a regular basis.</p>
