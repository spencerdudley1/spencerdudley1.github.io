<p>IP cameras are much higher resolution, enabling audio and video surveillance to be sent out over a network, with IP addresses designated to each camera. More technical in nature, IP camera systems will likely take more know-how to setup, and normally cost more than analog cameras. All detectors and sensing units interact with a control panel. These are available in two types: they can be a physical panel that's set up within the home on a wall, or a virtual panel that's available and controlled through smartphone or tablet.</p>
<p>IP cameras also have extra features that analog cameras do not use, such as video analytics, which permit mobile alerts and automated recording if there is movement within the camera's visual field. When your business is closed and you desire to understand if someone is moving around inside the premises, this is especially useful for times.
