We likewise experienced above-average connectivity problems, with 2 Hive test systems detaching eight times over 2 months. Scout is really simple to utilize, especially if you're a fan of mobile devices. The Scout mobile app works for iOS, Android, and web-based browsers, and it permits you to manage almost every element of the security system from another location, and it's extremely adjustable.

<p>Since it's more complex than it must be, we do not advise the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, informs, and integration all need different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for 1 month.
