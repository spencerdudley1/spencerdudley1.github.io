<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
