For the most comprehensive protection of your property, you desire something that consists of night vision and can tape at a good quality - and nearly all cameras now include a minimum of HD (1080p) resolution.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not excellent-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor.
