<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the same resolution specification as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being topped a much larger area and therefore uses less pixels per inch. Here is what this suggests, by way of an example. Assume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This implies the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread that image across a far bigger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>

Several of the cameras we checked provided the alternative to use battery power, but we have yet to find the perfect one. The designs we've examined up until now either record very brief clips, leave giant gaps in between those brief clips, or need charging regularly.</p>
