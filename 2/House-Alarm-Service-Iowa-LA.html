Another possible disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool should be replaced or charged regularly in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more costly than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is usually offset by the fact that there are no installation expenses.</p>

It can distinguish between basic motion and individuals, so it reduces incorrect alarms, and it can even recognize individuals you've labeled (after a knowing duration). But like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
<p>IP cameras likewise have extra functions that analog cameras do not provide, such as video analytics, which enable mobile notices and automated recording if there is motion within the camera's visual field.
