<h3>Security Alarms For Houses in Desoto TX</h3>
<p>Unlike conventional alarm systems, which have a control panel (typically positioned in the entrance hall) that is used to arm and disarm the alarm and alert you if any sensors have actually been activated, smart alarms are controlled from a smartphone app. The app lets you arm and deactivate the alarm, even if you've already left home, and informs you if any of the sensing units have been set off, instead of getting home to find your siren has been sounding all afternoon (and possibly annoying your neighbours).

<p>Closed circuit tv (CCTV) surveillance is a kind of situational criminal offense prevention designed to prevent both personal and property crime and can be used in place of, or in addition to, authorities. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and transfer pictures of a particular location of interest and are either monitored remotely by security workers or preprogramed to scan the specified location (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is thought that the increased surveillance provided by CCTV will minimize criminal activity and increase arrest, without displacing criminal offense to other close-by locations where CCTV is not in usage (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>
