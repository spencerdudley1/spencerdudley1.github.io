<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel published a video showing how to hack into a SimpliSafe system using a $2 remote. SimpliSafe reacted with a declaration saying the system would notify users when it discovered any type of disturbance. The company likewise questioned the video, declaring that there would need to be a best storm of situations for somebody to effectively hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using two various 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensors situated 6 to 26 feet far from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to replicate the concern.
