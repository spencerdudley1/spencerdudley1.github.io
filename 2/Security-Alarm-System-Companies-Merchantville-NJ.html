<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Must be a better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>
