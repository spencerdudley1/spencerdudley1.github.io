If a consumer has a lodged a complaint about the company, its staff, or its equipment, it will be on that website. Other third-party reviews sites should be inspected as well.

The 2nd important thing to say is that the Arlo Pro 2 has a surprisingly ear-piercing in-built alarm, so it works as a home alarm system along with a security camera.
