<p>Home security systems and modern-day wise home capabilities and compatibilities permit you to use their sensors and cameras directly from your phone.

Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using 2 different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensors situated 6 to 26 feet far from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were not able to reproduce the concern.
