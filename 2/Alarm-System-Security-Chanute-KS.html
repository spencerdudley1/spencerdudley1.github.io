<p>Your CCTV camera might make you feel physically more secure, but after reading this post, it will sure make you feel practically vulnerable.

<p>Conserving uncompressed digital recordings uses up a huge quantity of hard disk area, and a couple of hours of uncompressed video could quickly fill a hard drive. Holiday uncompressed recordings may look great but one could not run uncompressed quality recordings on a constant basis.

Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there.

<p>Cameras with built in wifi that speak with an existing network should be within 300 feet for optimal performance. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera near to the NVR is certainly something to be taken into account. For instance if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of a concern but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on second story wall, this would cause a disturbance in the signal.

<p>Most security cameras just send you a notification when they find any type of activity. Others can identify who-- or what-- is causing the turmoil.

This innovation helps remove needless signals.</p>
