Nevertheless, the reality that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute considerably to cops ability to apprehend intruders makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by authorities and whole neighborhoods (all taxpayers subsidize authorities reaction to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a inefficient and pricey technique to theft reduction across an entire jurisdiction.</p>
