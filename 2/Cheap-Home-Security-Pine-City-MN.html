<p>The Canary is one of the biggest cameras we evaluated, and it offers two-way communication with its paid Canary Membership. The cost of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't constant during our screening. The Netatmo Invite does not have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it constantly asked us to recognize already-identified faces. And regardless of having an attractive rate and good efficiency, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has confusing cloud storage that adds $65 to $150 per year to the cost of an otherwise spending plan camera.</p>
