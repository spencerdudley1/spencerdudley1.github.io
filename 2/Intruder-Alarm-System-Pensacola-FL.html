Instead, you can filter occasion alerts just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is better when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs each time you stroll by.
