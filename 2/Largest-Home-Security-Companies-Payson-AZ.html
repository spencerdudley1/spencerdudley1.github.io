Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and send pictures of a specific location of interest and are either monitored remotely by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the specified area (La Vigne et al. 2011).

<p>Twenty-five years ago, general and business interactions were mainly concurrent. To achieve almost anything, somebody live" required to be on the other side of the table or telephone line, particularly when handling worldwide and nationwide business. The exact same holds true for security and video surveillance. Usually, CCTV is most effective as an active system, with a security guard monitoring the corridors and someone else, someplace, enjoying video surveillance monitors for support. Everything is synchronized and whatever happens in real time.</p>
<p>Many home security systems are controlled by mobile phones which trend will continue. Systems will have less wall-mounted keypads, and instead, provide more controls to more gadgets. Wireless door, window, glass break, freeze, water and motion sensing units communicate with a center or base station in your home.
