<p>Twenty-five years ago, general and business interactions were mainly concurrent. To achieve almost anything, somebody live" required to be on the other side of the table or telephone line, particularly when handling worldwide and nationwide business. The exact same holds true for security and video surveillance.

Everything is synchronized and whatever happens in real time.</p>
<p>Many home security systems are controlled by mobile phones which trend will continue. Systems will have less wall-mounted keypads, and instead, provide more controls to more gadgets.
