Surveillance cameras are likewise produced in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. There are some challenging consequences to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not constantly better.</p>
