<p>No power? No concerns. Wireless security systems work even if there is a power outage in the home. Wired systems can not operate when a failure occurs, leaving the home unguarded.

This system might not be the best fit if you have a big backyard or sheds to protect. Unlike the outdoor Arlo cameras, the Arlo Q doesn't need a base station-- it links directly to any Wi-Fi network. However you can connect the Q with other Arlo outdoor and indoor cameras in the Arlo app, which is readily available for iOS, Android, Fire OS, and any Web web browser.

With many DIY systems, such as the SimpliSafe Home Security Kit, the Ring Alarm Security Kit, and the Nest Secure, you acquire the hardware outright and can prevent any monthly charges if you decide to self-monitor. If you include monitoring, costs will differ: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 monthly for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 per month. The cost of the Nest service drops to $19 per month if you commit to a three-year agreement. Ring's Protect Plus plan goes for $10 monthly and doesn't require an agreement.</p>
