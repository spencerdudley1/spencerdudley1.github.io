For instance, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a specific level, you can make it instantly switch off the heating unit. You can instantly make the smart lights turn on to scare away potential robbers if the motion sensing units are triggered.</p>

This guarantees that the equipment will carry out correctly in real-life situations when customers' health and safety is on the line.</p>
