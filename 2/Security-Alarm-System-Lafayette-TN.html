<p>We required guards for our annual Coats for the Cold occasion to protect the line tent and structure, keep order in the wee hours of the morning and to start the heating unit at 5am. The first guard arrived early so he might take a look at the whole location and talk to me about my issues. He was professional, courteous and very reassuring. The second guard arrived in the middle of the night and took over. When I showed up in the early morning to get the occasion started, he was also expert, encouraging and considerate.
