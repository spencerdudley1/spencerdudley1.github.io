<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring extensive however subtle modifications to the character of our public areas. When people are being enjoyed by the authorities - or aware they might be watched at any time - they are more uneasy and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has mentioned, "knowing that you are being viewed by armed federal government representatives tends to put a damper on things. You do not want to anger them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he cautions, "individuals might learn to be mindful about the periodicals and books they check out in public, avoiding titles that might alarm hidden observers. They might likewise put more thought into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang druggies, members or hookers."

<p>Although 1080p is normally the basic resolution for cameras we've checked, there are advantages to designs with higher-resolution sensing units. Few home security cameras have optical zoom lenses, however nearly all have digital zoom, which crop and expand whatever the camera is tape-recording. The more megapixels a camera sensing unit has, the more you can digitally focus and still have the ability to see things clearly.</p>
