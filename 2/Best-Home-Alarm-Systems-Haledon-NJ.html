<p>A camera with Wi-Fi can interact with your home network wirelessly, which can be convenient for installation. It also makes your camera more tamper-proof due to the fact that it does not have wires that can be cut. Sadly I purchased 4 cameras that look similar to these, thinking I was going to save $14.00 per camera for the same camera. Kid was I incorrect!! These cameras hold true 1080p and work completely right out of the box. They are well aligned and focused. The clearness is actually excellent. Night vision is true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you require to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
