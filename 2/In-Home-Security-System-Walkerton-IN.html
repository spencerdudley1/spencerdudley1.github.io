<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely typical since the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once clients understand that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically too late because the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
