<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring subtle but extensive changes to the character of our public spaces.

As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has actually pointed out, "knowing that you are being watched by armed government representatives tends to deter things. You do not wish to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he cautions, "individuals may learn to be cautious about the books and periodicals they check out in public, preventing titles that may alarm unseen observers. They might also put more believed into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang hookers, members or druggies."
