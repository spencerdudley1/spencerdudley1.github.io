<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely regular considering that the entrance and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, once clients recognize that the economical customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
