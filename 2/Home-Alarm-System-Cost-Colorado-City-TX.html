<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a much better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
