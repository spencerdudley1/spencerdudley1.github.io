For the ones that don't, you are able to see a live video feed of your home whenever you access your system; however, nothing is recorded. The systems with video storage normally include either a local storage or cloud storage alternative. A local storage option saves a pre-determined variety of video clips on the gadget itself. This option is generally cost-free. A cloud storage alternative saves your video in the cloud. However, this is generally a paid service and the number of hours it will keep will depend on just how much cloud storage you are willing to spend for.</p>

The financial independence alone makes this option much better for some households. Furthermore, most unmonitored security systems will send alerts to your smartphone, making it simple to know if there's a threat to your home.</p>
