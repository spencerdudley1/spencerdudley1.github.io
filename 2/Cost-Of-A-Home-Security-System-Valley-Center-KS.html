<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies developed their equipment this way to make customers stay with them longer, due to the fact that switching monitoring companies indicates hundreds of dollars down the drain and a huge headache for clients. How did they do it? They placed five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open internet. They were all running their most current software and firmware.

<p>Alarm monitoring belongs to a total home security system. It sounds an alarm within the home (often exceptionally high decibel so that you can hear it as can neighbors sometimes) and sounds an alarm with a professional monitoring company.
