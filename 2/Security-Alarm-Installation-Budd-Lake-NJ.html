Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the membership is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts every time you walk by. Unusually, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
