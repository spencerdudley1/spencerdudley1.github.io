<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Likewise great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
