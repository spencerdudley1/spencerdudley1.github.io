<p>The security systems I have actually designed and carried out are strictly for monitoring activity of a potential target, whether from a terrorist risk or neighborhood burglars or vandals. The systems are deployed for the protection of lives and property and not to enjoy individuals as they jaywalk across the street or run a traffic signal (which both are, by the way, versus the law).
