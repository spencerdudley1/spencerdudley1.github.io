Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and transfer images of a specific area of interest and are either monitored from another location by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the specified location (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is believed that the increased surveillance offered by CCTV will lower criminal activity and boost arrest, without displacing criminal activity to other neighboring locations where CCTV is not in usage (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>

Equipment can vary greatly between systems, but common products include a control panel, motion sensing units, windows and door sensing units, glass-break sensors, smoke alarm, and sirens.

Reception - Most reception locations in a business will be highly trafficked, therefore an ideal place for a camera installation.
