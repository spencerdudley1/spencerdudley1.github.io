<p>Since the glass housing doesn't get in the way, they aren't quite as vandal-proof as dome cameras, but they offset it in abilities. Along with being terrific for re-positioning on the fly, they are better for infrared and low-light since the glass housing doesn't impede the lens. With some, it's tough to tell at a glance where they have actually been aimed, so they can give a panoptic impression as a deterrent, despite their true field of view.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly outstanding by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
