<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the same resolution spec as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much broader area and for that reason provides fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this indicates, by method of an example. Presume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the very same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image throughout a far larger area and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
