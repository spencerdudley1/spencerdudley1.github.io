<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product classification is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security experts looking into Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Webcam (KC120) for among our top spots. Nevertheless, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of as much as 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can tape-record as much as 3 minutes without spaces in between clips, however entries were often missing, despite appearing in the app's activity timeline.

But while SimpliSafe has less client service availability, it provides financial flexibility that ADT does not match.

<p>Cameras with built in wifi that talk with an existing network should be within 300 feet for optimum efficiency. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera near the NVR is absolutely something to be taken into account.

A wireless bridge is a great choice for long variety scenarios where poles and trees are not present.</p>

The Angee is short on features and big on running expenses. The Ooma Butterfleye has no night vision and has bad daytime video; the Reolink C1 Pro often displayed pink and green lines throughout the screen; the Yi Dome Camera continuously flickered in the evening; and the Samsung SmartCam had bad audio and a confusing app.</p>
