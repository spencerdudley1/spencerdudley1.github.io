<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Likewise great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.
