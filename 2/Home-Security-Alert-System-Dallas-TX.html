<p>When looking at a regular camera image, you would be hard-pressed to tell the difference between 1080p and 4K resolution. The one major benefit of 4K resolution is the capability to resolve information after the fact, which implies that users can zoom in on information such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. However, while 4K resolution offers some benefits, it also brings with it some drawbacks. 4K images are very large and take up a great deal of tape-recording storage space. So much, in truth, that they need about four times the hard disk drive area of 1080p to tape the same length of video footage. Be prepared to invest more money if extended video storage is very important.</p>
