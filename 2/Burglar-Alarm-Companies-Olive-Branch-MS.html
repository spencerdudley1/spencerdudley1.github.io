<p>Brinks Home Security, one of the recognized names in the market, recently received a facelift after MONI Smart Security acquired the name rights to the company and offered the company a major overhaul. The new and improved Brinks Home Security uses MONI monitoring and Livewatch DIY security systems for a more modern-day plan. In regards to cost, Brinks is someplace in the mid-range: not the most inexpensive, but not the most pricey, either.

And if you want to save 4K videos, it's an additional $1.99 per camera per month, on top of the monthly strategy, the latter of which is waived for the very first year.
