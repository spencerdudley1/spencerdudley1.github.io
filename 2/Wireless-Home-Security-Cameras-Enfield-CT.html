Alarm monitoring is not just a budget-friendly way to protect your home or business from burglary, medical and fire emergency situations, however it might pay for itself!

Across 76 studies, Piza and coworkers (2019) found that closed circuit television (CCTV) surveillance had a statistically substantial effect on general criminal activity (OR = 1.14).

<p>Repaired security cameras point in a single instructions, which makes them perfect for monitoring extremely specific areas of interest.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic.
