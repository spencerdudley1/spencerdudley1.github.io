<p>Keep in mind: The above CCTV camera types only touch the IP camera world and neglect the old analog cameras, considered that everybody prefers IP cameras today for their budget friendly prices, functions and simple setup.

A wired security camera can come in 2 forms, both requiring wires to provide power and for the functions of video transmission.

They link to the company's particular app, so you're always in the know. Frontpoint's flood sensors cost just $44.99 and provide 3 to 5 times more variety than ADT's and Vivint's.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially excellent by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
