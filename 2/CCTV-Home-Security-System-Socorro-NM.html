<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter event notifications only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes.
