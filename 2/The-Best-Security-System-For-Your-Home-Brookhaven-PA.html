<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring subtle but extensive modifications to the character of our public areas. When people are being viewed by the authorities - or aware they may be enjoyed at any time - they are more awkward and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has explained, "knowing that you are being watched by armed federal government agents tends to put a damper on things. You don't want to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he cautions, "individuals may discover to be cautious about the books and regulars they check out in public, avoiding titles that may alarm hidden observers.
