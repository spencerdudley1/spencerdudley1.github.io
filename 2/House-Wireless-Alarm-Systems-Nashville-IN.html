<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, accommodating sophisticated wise home fanatics or fans of a specific ecosytem of products. Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I checked, consisting of smart things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit. But the Secure is pricey, extra sensing units are costly, and the monitoring service-- which doesn't include smoke alarm or camera backups-- is likewise costly if you do not commit to a three-year agreement.</p>
<p>You can choose from SimpliSafe's initial award-winning system or their latest line of equipment. Both systems offer impressive, trusted home security. With the newer system, you will pay more, however that greater cost includes a system that is smaller, faster, and more powerful.
