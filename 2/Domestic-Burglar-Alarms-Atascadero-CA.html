<h3>Wireless Security System Atascadero CA 93422</h3>
<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring subtle but profound changes to the character of our public areas. When residents are being seen by the authorities - or aware they might be seen at any time - they are more awkward and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has pointed out, "knowing that you are being seen by armed federal government representatives tends to deter things. You don't wish to anger them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he warns, "people may find out to be mindful about the books and periodicals they check out in public, preventing titles that may alarm unseen observers. They may also put more thought into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang members, hookers or druggies." Undoubtedly, the studies of cameras in Britain found that people considered to be "out of time and location" with the surroundings were subjected to extended surveillance.</p>
