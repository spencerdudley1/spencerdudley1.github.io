<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range".

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely typical because the entrance and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
