<p>Closed circuit television (CCTV) surveillance is a form of situational criminal activity avoidance developed to prevent both individual and property criminal offense and can be utilized in place of, or in addition to, cops. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and send pictures of a specific area of interest and are either monitored from another location by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the defined location (La Vigne et al. 2011).

<p>Unlike most other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter event notifications only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When utilized in high-traffic areas, the membership is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs every time you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
