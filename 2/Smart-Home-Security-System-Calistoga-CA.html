<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Also great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Must be a much better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
