<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Plus, Amcrest is ONVIF compliant, which implies you can use a number of different third-party apps, like Blue Iris, and make the camera work with other ONVIF-compliant gadgets. We believe alarm systems work best when integrated with all parts of your security system, such as video monitoring and gain access to control.

<p>CCTV cameras are better at catching lawbreakers after they have actually committed a criminal offense, instead of being able to stop a criminal activity in development.
