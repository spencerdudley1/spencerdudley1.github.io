<p>DITEK's alarm system surge protectors secure your security system against short-term surges that can enter through AC power lines, telephone lines and remote alert zones. The Piper NV is primarily a camera. It provides night vision and a wide-angle view so you can use one camera to monitor a big space.

<p>At night, though it does not have the complete IR LED array of some competitors, the Arlo records enough light to see a good range, and there's an adjustable spotlight readily available if you're positioning it outdoors - which neatly brings us to the wonderful motion detection. Not only is the Arlo fast to select moving products, it's brainy enough to make a decent stab at working out exactly what it's taking a look at. Just a couple years ago, the home security market was controlled by a couple of huge names using expensive, stiff plans with little flexibility and unfriendly, long-term agreements. Systems were restricted to a couple wired motion sensing units connected to a keypad control board and go through a landline. Nowadays, this has all altered.</p>

Such a gadget is comparable in performance to a PC with a capture card and appropriate video recording software Unlike PCs, many DVRs designed for CCTV functions are ingrained gadgets that need less maintenance and simpler setup than a PC-based service, for a medium to a large number of analogue cameras. Due to the fact that everything is simply stuck onto the wall and not hardwired, removing cameras, detectors, and other parts of a wireless security system and putting them up in a new location takes minutes, not days. Wireless systems are the method to go if you rent and move often.</p>
