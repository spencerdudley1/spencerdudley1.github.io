<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Also good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Must be a better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
