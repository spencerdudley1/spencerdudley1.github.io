<p>To determine reaction times for the monitoring company, we triggered each system a minimum of five times, utilizing contact and motion sensors. However, bear in mind that the monitoring company's reaction time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm-- if they respond at all. In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls must be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City needs confirmation from a private security guard. Several cities also need an authorization to even operate a home and own security system. Rules such as these are developed to restrict the time and resources that police and fire departments waste on false alarms. Lots of municipalities will fine you for too many incorrect alarms.</p>
<p>An expertly monitored system is watched by an alarm company from a monitoring center. The company contacts the homeowner and the authorities if there's an issue. If the house owner verifies there isn't an emergency, police aren't called. If the house owner can't be reached, the company accesses the scenario and can contact the authorities if needed. Homeowners spend for a security system to be expertly monitored. There's a regular monthly monitoring charge that normally ranges between $15-40 a month.</p>
