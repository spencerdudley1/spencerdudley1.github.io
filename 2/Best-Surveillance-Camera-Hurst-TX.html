<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually discovered that battery life never matches the producer's stats because this comes from tests in a controlled environment without continuous video recording, which is the most significant offender for short battery life by far. We agree with you about Blink's remarkable battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, however its recording capacity is a bit restricted to suggest as a top choice.</p>
<p>Unmonitored systems won't provide the same level of protection for your home, either. Even if your system links to your smart device, there are times when you might not remain in a position to do anything about an alarm going off, like when you're on a plane, in an essential meeting, or in an area without phone reception. Put simply, security doorbells are simply small security cameras - wired or wireless - that consist of a door buzzer and a 2-way intercom in the frame. Integrating the benefits of a security camera and an intercom provides you a large range of effective features to secure your home or business.</p>
<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly outstanding by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. But if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
