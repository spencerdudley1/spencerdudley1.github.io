<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and then combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally regular given that the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
