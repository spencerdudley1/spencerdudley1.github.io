Nevertheless, bear in mind that the monitoring company's response time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm-- if they react at all. In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls must be verified, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City needs verification from a private security personnel. A number of cities likewise need an authorization to even own and run a home security system.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and then combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally regular given that the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
