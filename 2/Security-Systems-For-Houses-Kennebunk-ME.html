SimpliSafe reacted with a declaration stating the system would notify users when it discovered any kind of disturbance. The company also questioned the video, declaring that there would need to be a perfect storm of situations for somebody to effectively hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using 2 various 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensors located 6 to 26 feet far from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were not able to replicate the problem.

<p>What many individuals do not recognize is that there is another class of security camera that is directly offered to the public, though not discovered in the big box and warehouse stores.
