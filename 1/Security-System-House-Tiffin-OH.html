<p>Developing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or house is the responsibility of the entire neighborhood. Storage capability: For video recorders, the first concern you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The answer hinges on a couple of aspects: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video you mean to store and for how long you plan to keep taped video footage. The video is going to consume up storage area quickly if there are lots of cameras shooting in a greater resolution.
