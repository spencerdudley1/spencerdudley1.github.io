<p>No incorrect alarm penalties: Homeowners with a self-monitored system are less likely to dispatch the authorities for a false alarm. Because the house owner supervises of the system, cops are only called if there's a real emergency. On the other hand, an expert monitoring company will call authorities if a house owner can't confirm an incorrect alarm. If  authorities are contacted for an incorrect alarm, property owners may need to pay a fine for dispatching authorities needlessly. A self-monitored home limits the capacity for subsequent penalties and incorrect alarms.</p>

<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
