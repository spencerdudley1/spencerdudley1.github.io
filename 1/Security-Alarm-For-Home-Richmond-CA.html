<p>So, while alarm systems may have some advantage for alarm owners as part of an overall security bundle, the question stays whether non-alarm owners in the community should take on a share of the cost. If alarm use led to enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much higher burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, less robberies throughout an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more obvious.
