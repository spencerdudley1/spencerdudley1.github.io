<h3>Home Security Cameras in California</h3>
<p>Since it's more complex than it ought to be, we do not suggest the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, informs, and combination all require different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly cost (or $80 each year) to store 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limitations, we often found action missing, thanks to irregular and prolonged spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
<p>The Nest Web cam IQ Outdoor streams 1080p video with the very same membership design and very same app as the initial Nest Camera Outdoor, however it adds in more-detailed individual detection, a brighter image, an automated close-up tracking function (which follows a person around the viewing area), better audio, a more powerful mount, and a larger operating temperature variety (-40 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit).

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly remarkable on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic.
