<p>A wired security system was the first type of security system that was created for homeowners. It should be set up by an expert alarm installation group and, as soon as set up, is hard to move from one location to another. Wired systems are more common for large residential or commercial properties and are typically more pricey than a wireless home security system. They can include outdoor cameras and an indoor camera just like the wireless system. In order to install the hardwired security system, the group will need to remodel the existing wires in your house. The team will be able to recycle the existing circuitry if you've already installed a wired system in the past and you are updating to a new system. However, if this is your first system, the alarm installation procedure can take upwards of 3 hours.</p>
<p>When the alarm company representative has made an appraisal of your security needs, ask him for a composed proposal and a copy of the agreement you will need to sign.
