<h3>Monitored Home Security in Michigan</h3>
<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the exact same resolution specification as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much broader area and for that reason offers less pixels per inch. Here is what this implies, by method of an example. Presume two cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread that image throughout a far bigger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
<p>There's a couple of other cool features in the camera itself such as an automatic zoom which tracks moving objects if it finds an intruder; a convenient intercom function that allows the device to act as a smart doorbell (although it doesn't have a chime or button - for that you'll require the Nest Hello doorbell ); and, considering that Alphabet owns Nest, the camera carries Google Assistant. Security combined with wise home automation creates the most trustworthy, innovative home security possible. It's why we develop clever home tech products and integrate with clever products from companies like Google and Amazon. A clever home is a secure home.</p>
