<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against vandalism, theft, and fraud. Tip: Typically keyholders are not readily available and the alarm does not reset. We must again respond to the alarm; each response is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates.

<p>The NVR gets rid of these problems, because it is instead connected directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the very same network, normally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply since they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The largest downside to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.
