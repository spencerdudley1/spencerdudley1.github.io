<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring extensive however subtle changes to the character of our public areas. When people are being watched by the authorities - or aware they may be watched at any time - they are more uneasy and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has pointed out, "knowing that you are being viewed by armed government representatives tends to put a damper on things. You don't want to anger them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he alerts, "people may discover to be careful about the regulars and books they read in public, preventing titles that might alarm hidden observers.
