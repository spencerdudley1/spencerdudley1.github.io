Not just is the Arlo fast to pick out moving products, it's brainy enough to make a good stab at working out precisely what it's looking at. Just a couple decades back, the home security market was controlled by a few huge names offering costly, rigid strategies with little flexibility and unfriendly, long-term contracts.
