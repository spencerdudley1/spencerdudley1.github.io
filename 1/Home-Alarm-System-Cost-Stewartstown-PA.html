<p>Do you own your alarm equipment? Another factor to read your existing alarm agreement carefully. ADT for instance uses totally free" home security systems when you register for their multiyear alarm monitoring plan. Clearly absolutely nothing is totally free. In this case the alarm company owns the main equipment such as control board, keypad, motion sensor.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not terrific-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing.

Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>
