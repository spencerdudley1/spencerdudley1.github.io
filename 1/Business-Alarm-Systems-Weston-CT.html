<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Likewise great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Must be a much better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
