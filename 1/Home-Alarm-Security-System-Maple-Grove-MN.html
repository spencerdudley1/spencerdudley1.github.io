<h3>Home Camera Surveillance in Maple Grove MN</h3>

We tested Somfy's more costly system, which included a wifi security camera, however more affordable sets are likewise readily available. Despite the substantial cost here, there's no external monitoring option.</p>

Given that this camera has no native geofencing functions, you need to manually stop notifications (and recording, given that it does that even when alerts are off). We also experienced above-average connectivity concerns, with two Hive test units disconnecting 8 times over two months.

Likewise, the wired variation generally left spaces of as much as 7 seconds in between 1-minute recordings, while the battery variation left about a minute in between 30-second clips. Both likewise do not have person detection and geofencing, which other cameras utilize to minimize incorrect signals.</p>
