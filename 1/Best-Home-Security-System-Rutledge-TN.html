Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limitations, we typically found action missing, thanks to inconsistent and lengthy spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
