IP cameras that are connected to the very same network, normally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer footage to the NVR.

In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transfer video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is linked to the very same network as the NVR. The biggest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will work with an offered video recorder prior to buying.</p>
