<p>As an incentive to buy an alarm, a number of companies provide "totally free monitoring services" for the very first few months. Many insurer provide discounts on insurance premiums to customers with operable alarm. These discount rates may be as much as 20 percent for commercial clients, and somewhat less for residential owners. 16 In addition, many police departments provide numerous "complimentary" incorrect alarms before enforcing any fine, despite the fact that the cost to respond is substantial right from the start. The offers of complimentary monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance providers bring into question the suitability of the existing trend in U.S. policing of enabling 3 or four complimentary false alarms per fiscal year, because they provide no up-front rewards to encourage owners to prevent false alarms.</p>
