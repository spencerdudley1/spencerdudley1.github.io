<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range".

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally normal since the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
