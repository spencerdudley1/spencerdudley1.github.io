<p>A wired security system was the first type of security system that was created for property owners. It must be set up by a professional alarm installation group and, as soon as set up, is difficult to move from one place to another. Wired systems are more common for big homes and are often more costly than a wireless home security system. They can include outdoor cameras and an indoor camera much like the wireless system. In order to install the hardwired security system, the team will need to rework the existing wires in your house. If you've already installed a wired system in the past and you are updating to a new system, the team will be able to reuse the existing electrical wiring.

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. But if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
