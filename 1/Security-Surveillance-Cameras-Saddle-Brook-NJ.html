<p>Research studies reveal surveillance cameras reduce criminal activity. HD CCTV systems work with standard analog CCTV cameras. If you purchased cameras prior to 2010 or if you have coax cable television (take a look at the cord behind the TV that goes to the cable television box) in your existing security system that indicates you have traditional analog CCTV security cameras.

Tech is supposed to make our lives simpler and Hive's ecosystem lives up to that. It's all the function with no aggravation.</p>
