<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your house so we might point them at the same spot and expose them all to the exact same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had actually set up on the deck by a certified electrician (who happens to be my spouse). All of the cameras were connected to the same 2.4 GHz network by means of a Wi-Fi router indoors (around 40 feet from the cameras); service to your home was Verizon Fios.</p>
