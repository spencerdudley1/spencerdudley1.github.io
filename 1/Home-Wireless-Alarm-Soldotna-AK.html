Where does the video feed go? Does the camera store to an SD card, which you'll need to by hand get rid of to transfer the data? Does it go to your smart device, or upload to services like Dropbox? For the best security, you desire the information to be backed up in multiple locations. Another factor is how many days of video footage are archived.
