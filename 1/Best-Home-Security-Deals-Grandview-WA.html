<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the exact same resolution spec as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being topped a much larger location and for that reason uses less pixels per inch. Here is what this implies, by way of an example. Presume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image across a far larger area and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>

Consumers have the option to buy the equipment or rent (which includes a lifetime assurance).
