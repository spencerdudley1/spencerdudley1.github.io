In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The biggest drawback to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.
