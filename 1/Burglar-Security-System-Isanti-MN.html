<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
