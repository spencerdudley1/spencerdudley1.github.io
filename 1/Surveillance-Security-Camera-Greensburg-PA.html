<p>Are you in a home with a pre-wired security system? Having a hardwired security system set up might be a much easier and more inexpensive choice if so. However if your home currently has no pre-wired security system, a wireless one gets rid of the requirement for drilling into your walls and also gives you the choice of a Do It Yourself install.
