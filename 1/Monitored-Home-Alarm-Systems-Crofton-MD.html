Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there.

<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky.

Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>

<p>When using IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the large quantity of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely quick speeds, and typically over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trustworthy, but not suitable with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will likewise power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for further wiring. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may need less wiring in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera individually, generally through 110VAC power.</p>
