<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a malicious assailant, given that the disturbance of the network prevents the circulation of information and in fact indirectly secures information by preventing it from being sent.

This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools available which can release a dictionary design attack of "possibly accepted" security keys based upon the "design" security essential caught during the network healing.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally normal since the entrance and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when clients realize that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's usually too late given that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
