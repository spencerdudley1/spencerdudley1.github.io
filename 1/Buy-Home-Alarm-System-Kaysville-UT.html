<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>

<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is an enjoyment to use also (a lot better than the apps you get with some budget plan security cameras), though if you wish to enter its cleverest customisations, there is a bit of a learning curve. For even more basic smarts, it's great, though.
