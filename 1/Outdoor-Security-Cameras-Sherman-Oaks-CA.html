Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the membership is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs whenever you walk by.
