<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Likewise good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
