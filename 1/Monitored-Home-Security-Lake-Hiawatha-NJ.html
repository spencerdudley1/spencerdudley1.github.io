These discounts might be as much as 20 percent for commercial customers, and somewhat less for residential owners. 16 In addition, numerous authorities departments use numerous "totally free" false alarms before imposing any fine, although the cost to react is substantial right from the start.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not fantastic-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
