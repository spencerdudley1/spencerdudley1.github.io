<p>Basically, a wireless security system is consisted of alarms, sensors, cameras, and different detectors all connected to a main control board through radio signals. For instance, a four-camera system that runs 24 hr a day using IP cameras, each with a 2-megapixel resolution and a frame rate of 5 fps, with video compressed into MJPEG files on a NVR, would need 2.79 terabytes of storage space for footage, according to the Supercircuits calculator.</p>

In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance constraints so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR. The largest downside to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.

<p>The Wisenet SmartCam N2 provides complimentary benefits like individual detection, familiar-face signals, and local storage on a microSD card. (Cloud storage begins at $5 monthly.) However, in our tests the familiar-face signals worked only about 50 percent of the time and the camera routinely disconnected from the network several times a day (when everything else on our network appeared fine). The app was also painfully slow when we accessed live streams and tape-recorded clips, as well as when we made modifications in the settings.</p>
