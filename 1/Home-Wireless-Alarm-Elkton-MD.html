<p>Unlike traditional alarm systems, which have a control board (generally situated in the entryway hall) that is utilized to arm and deactivate the alarm and alert you if any sensing units have been triggered, wise alarms are controlled from a mobile phone app. The app lets you arm and deactivate the alarm, even if you have actually currently left home, and notifies you if any of the sensing units have actually been activated, instead of getting home to discover your siren has been sounding all afternoon (and possibly annoying your neighbours).

Tech is expected to make our lives much easier and Hive's environment measures up to that. It's all the function without any disappointment.</p>
