<p>If you live in a small apartment and want to keep tabs on things when you're not home, a security camera can get the job done for a lot less money than what you'll pay for a complete security system. Almost all standalone security cameras connect to your home's Wi-Fi so you can see what's going on from your phone or tablet, and many have integrated sensing units that detect motion and noise and will send push and e-mail notices when those sensing units are set off. You can generally modify the camera's motion sensitivity to avoid false alarms due to animal activity or passing cars if the camera is near a window, and you can develop a schedule that turns the sensing units on and off during certain hours of the day.</p>
<p>Downsides: extremely conscious weather; as rain, fog, and snow, for example, would trigger the sensing units to stop working, and need sterile perimeter line since trees and bushes or anything that blocks the beam would cause incorrect alarm or absence of detection. If wise home security is what you seek, we suggest checking out Vivint or ADT prior to jumping on the cheaper, DIY bandwagon.
