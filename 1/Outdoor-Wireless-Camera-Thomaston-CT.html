<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
