<p>The majority of security cameras can be used both inside and outdoors. They normally have the same functions like night vision or remote viewing, but they vary in toughness. Outdoor cameras must be weather resistant and in many cases, entirely water resistant. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather condition resistance score are the most resilient. Bullet cameras tend to be among the most popular outdoor alternatives due to the fact that their style enables minimum glare. In terms of detection, it is better to have a camera equipped with infrared detection rather than motion detection. Because often times the motion detection is set off by motion such as a tree blowing or an animal running by, this will offer more precise and less regular alerts.</p>
