<p>Unlike standard alarm systems, which have a control panel (normally located in the entrance hall) that is utilized to deactivate the alarm and equip and alert you if any sensing units have actually been set off, smart alarms are controlled from a smart device app. The app lets you arm and deactivate the alarm, even if you've already left home, and informs you if any of the sensing units have actually been triggered, rather than getting home to find your siren has been sounding all afternoon (and possibly annoying your neighbours).

Never install a security camera (or a router or any other device on your home network) without altering its default user ID and password.</p>
