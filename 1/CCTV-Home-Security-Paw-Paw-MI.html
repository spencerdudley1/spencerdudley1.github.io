<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Likewise good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Should be a better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>

<h3>Wireless Home Alarm Systems Paw Paw MI 49079</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've found that battery life never matches the producer's statistics since this comes from tests in a controlled environment without constant video recording, which is the greatest offender for brief battery life by far.

<p>That's due to the fact that pro monitoring uses more security than Do It Yourself monitoring can. Do It Yourself monitoring depends totally on you, business owner, to work.
