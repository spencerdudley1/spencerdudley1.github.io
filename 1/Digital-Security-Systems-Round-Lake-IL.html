Storage capability: For video recorders, the first concern you have to ask yourself is how much storage you will require. The answer depends upon a number of factors: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you intend to save and the length of time you prepare to keep taped video. If there are many cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the video footage is going to consume storage area rapidly.

<p>While not a vital requirement for a home security system, all top companies offer a variety of camera choices as add-ons.
