<h2>Wireless Home Security Cameras & Video Surveillance Systems Middletown</h2>
<p>The disadvantage to a wireless system is that it depends on a wireless signal, suggesting that storms and strong winds have the power to interrupt the system and could even trigger incorrect alarms. Incorrect alarms are known to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could result in fines from the provider or the cops if they occur regularly enough. Another possible drawback to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool need to be changed or charged routinely in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more pricey than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is typically offset by the reality that there are no installation costs.</p>
<p>Wireless home security is versatile. If you do not like where a sensing unit or camera is put, move it. There are no wires stopping you.
