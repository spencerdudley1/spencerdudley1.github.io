<p>There are two primary kinds of cameras that can be wired into a video surveillance system: internet protocol (IP) cameras and the conventional analog cameras. IP cameras are the more modern-day version of analog cameras, and while the specific cameras tend to be a bit more expensive, they offer a variety of features that analog cameras do not. Here's a look at the distinctions between the 2 types of camera. Today's wireless home security systems are more stable than they used to be.
