<h3>Security System Monitoring Spring Grove PA 17362</h3>
<p>Nurse calling systems usually consist of emergency buttons or pull strings within the patient's washroom. If a patient is having problem, he can press the button or pull the string and it will send out an alert to the nurse station. This is a simple switch that is typically open or normally closed.
