<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don.

<p>This awesome clever alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device. During testing, we discovered it was easy to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was precise, with the siren rapidly activating when movement was spotted. We enjoy that it likewise lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For most homes, you'll require several Minuts throughout your home, which can get expensive. It's likewise worth noting that it needs to be set up on the ceiling (it only monitors for motion in the 25m squared listed below), which is fiddly. It likewise had the quietest alarm of all that we checked and there's no external monitoring service offered.</p>

If you desire home security that blends into your decoration and does not draw attention to itself, then wireless is the better option.
