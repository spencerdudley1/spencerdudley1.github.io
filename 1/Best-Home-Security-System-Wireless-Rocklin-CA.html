<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Likewise great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
