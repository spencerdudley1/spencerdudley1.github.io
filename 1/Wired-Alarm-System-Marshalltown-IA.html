<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you desire one? Here is a brief explanation of how thermal cameras work: All items discharge infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature. The infrared energy emitted by an item is referred to as its heat signature. In basic, the hotter an item is, the more radiation it emits. A thermal camera consists of a heat sensing unit that is capable of finding small distinctions in temperature. The device collects the infrared radiation from items in the scene and develops an electronic image based on details about the temperature differences.
