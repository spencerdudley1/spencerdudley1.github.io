When this electrical current is not being transferred it triggers a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which indicates if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If somebody were to unlock that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then set off the alarm system.
