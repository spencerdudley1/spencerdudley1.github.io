<p>Simply bought a bullet ip system and definitely love it. Fantastic clearness. I wanted to set up seeing on my cell phone but had a couple questions that the tech answered with ease. I Would absolutely buy from cctvsecuritypros once again. I extremely suggest this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stick out-- it's what offers the video history and smarter alerts, for example. However, those features come at a relatively high cost: $5 each month ($50 each year) for the first camera for five days of video history, $10 each month ($100 each year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 monthly ($300 per year) for 30 days of video history.

<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've discovered that battery life never ever matches the manufacturer's stats given that this originates from tests in a regulated environment without constant video recording, which is the biggest offender for short battery life by far. We concur with you about Blink's remarkable battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, however its recording capacity is a bit limited to advise as a top pick.</p>
<p>It would be simple to roll your eyes at this last point, but it suggests you can ask your home security camera for the weather forecast - or whatever Google search takes your fancy - and a speaker within the system will reply.

Which, you imagine, would suffice to send out even the most dedicated career criminal scuttling empty-handed down the roadway.</p>
