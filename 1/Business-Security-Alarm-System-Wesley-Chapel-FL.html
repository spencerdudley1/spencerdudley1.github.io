<p>The NVR removes these problems, due to the fact that it is rather linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the very same network, normally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely since they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transfer footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The biggest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
