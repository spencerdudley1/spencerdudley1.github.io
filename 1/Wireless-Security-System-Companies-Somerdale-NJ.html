<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. ADT likewise has more industry experience and more monitoring centers than SimpliSafe.

The chance that the fixed camera would be pointed in the instructions of the occurrence depends on the initial requirements for location of coverage. If there are 3 select fire escape, panic alarms, or door sensing units, a single set camera can only view one. This creates a one in 3 opportunity of capturing a specific event on video (either live or taped). The command center likewise included a computer system designated for submitting event reports online.
