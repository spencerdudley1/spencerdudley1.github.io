<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. ADT likewise has more industry experience and more monitoring centers than SimpliSafe.

If there are 3 select fire escape, panic alarms, or door sensing units, a single set camera can only view one. This creates a one in 3 opportunity of capturing a specific event on video (either live or taped).
