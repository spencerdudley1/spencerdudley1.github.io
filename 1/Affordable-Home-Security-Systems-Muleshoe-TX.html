<p>Nonetheless, multi-megapixel IP-CCTV cameras are beginning the market. Still quite pricey, but they can catch video images at resolutions of 1, 2, 3, 5 and even up to 11 Mpix. Unlike with analogue cameras, information such as number plates are easily legible. At 11 Mpix, forensic quality images are made where each hand on a person can be differentiated.

Thankfully, security system producers appear to have caught on to this concern and addressed it through wireless security cameras. These gadgets use short-range innovations (e.g., Z-wave) or broadband to send video - and often audio - signals to a receiver that links to your recording and viewing gadget. Wireless cameras are best utilized with cloud storage to assist in smooth video surveillance monitoring.</p>
