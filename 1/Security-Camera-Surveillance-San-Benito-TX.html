For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies created their equipment this way to make customers stick with them longer, due to the fact that changing monitoring companies means numerous dollars down the drain and a big headache for consumers.

If there are three choose emergency exits, panic alarms, or door sensing units, a single set camera can just see one. This creates a one in three chance of catching a particular occurrence on video (either live or tape-recorded). The command center also consisted of a computer designated for submitting occurrence reports online. These can be accessed by management workers at a later date from a database via the computer network.</p>

<p>The genuine reason cameras are normally deployed is to decrease much pettier crimes. But it has not even been shown that they can do that. In Britain, where cameras have been extensively released in public places, sociologists studying the issue have actually found that they have not reduced criminal offense. "When the crime and offense figures were adapted to take account of the general downward trend in crimes and offenses," criminologists discovered in one research study, "reductions were kept in mind in specific categories however there was no evidence to recommend that the cameras had actually decreased crime overall in the city centre." A 2005 study for the British Office also discovered that cameras did not cut crime or the fear of criminal offense (as had a 2002 study, also for the British government).</p>
