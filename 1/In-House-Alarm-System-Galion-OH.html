<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Likewise good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
