<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that seems to strive to make a camera with the most difficult setup understood to male. Here's how it plays out: First you need to download the app and put in your e-mail address. Then you go into the WiFi details of the network you're trying to link to.

<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Likewise great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Should be a better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
