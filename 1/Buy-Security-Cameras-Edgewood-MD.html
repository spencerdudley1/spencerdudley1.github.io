<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not great-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion activates.</p>

Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If somebody were to unlock that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then trigger the burglar alarm. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door permits the electrical current to flow throughout the system, which implies when the doors are shut the alarm system will set off.</p>
