<p>Multiple monitors were set up within the new command center with a single monitor assigned to alarm displays.

<p>The Wisenet SmartCam N2 delivers free perks like individual detection, familiar-face informs, and local storage on a microSD card. (Cloud storage begins at $5 per month.) However, in our tests the familiar-face signals worked just about 50 percent of the camera and the time routinely disconnected from the network numerous times a day (when everything else on our network seemed fine). The app was likewise painfully slow when we accessed live streams and tape-recorded clips, as well as when we made modifications in the settings.</p>
<h3>Largest Home Security Companies in Colorado</h3>
