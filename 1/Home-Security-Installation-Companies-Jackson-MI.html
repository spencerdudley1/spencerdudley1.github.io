<p>Unlike many other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter occasion notifications just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is better when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs every time you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
