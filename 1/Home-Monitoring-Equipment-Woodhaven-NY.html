<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that appears to make every effort to make a camera with the most difficult setup known to guy. Here's how it plays out: First you have to download the app and put in your email address. Then you go into the WiFi details of the network you're trying to connect to. Then the phone plays a screeching, electronic sound wave to the camera to transfer the WiFi information. (You need to play this at complete volume or it will not work). Windows smash, pets shout, cats scream, infants sob. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the first ten seconds. It does not work. And it never works.</p>
<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
