Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is more useful when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs whenever you stroll by.
