<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus fraud, theft, and vandalism. Recommendation: Often keyholders are not offered and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we must once again respond to the alarm; each reaction is billed. Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one method of getting rid of pricey false alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a specific level, you can make it automatically shut off the heater. If the motion sensors are activated, you can immediately make the clever lights turn on to scare away possible burglars.</p>
<p>Some alarm systems enable you to deactivate and equip from your mobile phone. That's a practical feature, but it does not eliminate the need for at least one keypad arming station.

<p>When using IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the large amount of information required by digital video and high resolutions at very quick speeds, and frequently over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reliable, but not compatible with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for further electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may require less electrical wiring in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera independently, usually via 110VAC power.</p>
<p>Analogue signals can also be converted into a digital signal to enable the recordings to be stored on a PC as digital recordings Because case the analogue video camera must be plugged straight into a video capture card in the computer, and the card then transforms the analogue signal to digital. These cards are fairly cheap, but inevitably the resulting digital signals are compressed 5:1 (MPEG compression) in order for the video recordings to be minimized a continuous basis.</p>
